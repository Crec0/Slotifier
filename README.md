# Slotifier
A simple slot reservation mod. Reserve slots in the player inventory and never worry about picking wrong items and sorting them all over again.

Simply customize your inventory in whatever way you want and hit the save key. Afterwards you can empty your inventory and go to the mining adventure without worrying about picking up rotten flesh, bones, seeds and other garbage.

If you are technical player, you can use this to present your inventory before mass crafting difficult recipes like dispensers. Just throw few thousand bows on ground and save your inventory and start crafting. 

## Usage
To use this mod you have to set the hotkey for it. You can find the settings in the Options > Controls in minecraft menu.
